## Introduction  
  
This repo contains five scripts that use the raw data from 
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, the scripts use the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" downloaded from:
  
* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]  
  

Using this dataset, four plots identified in the following repository 
are reduced:

## Instruction List: How to Run the Scripts in This Repo  

<ol> 
<li>Download the raw data from the website listed above.</li> 
<li>Unzip the downloaded zip file and 
extract "household_power_consumption.txt"</li>
<li>In the same folder, copy "preprocess.R" script and run it.
It generates "power_consumption.rds" data file.</li> 
<li>Run plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, and plot4.R. Each of these 
scripts produces .png file with the same file name as the script.</li>
